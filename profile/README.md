# Rusty Ferris Club 🦀

This is an old-school computer club brought to the 21st century. It's non-profit and open-source based, with the single goal of the _joy of learning and building in Rust_. 

By joining, you can expect the following:

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Friendly discussion and chat about topics in Rust.  
* 🔮 Mentor or volunteer as a mentor for other members around contributing to Rust _open source_ projects from idea to finish.  
* ❓ Co-maintainership and co-creativity - getting a helping hand now and then from others when you're unavailable, need someone to think with, or need a missing skill (as long as it's under the `rusty-ferris-club` org). 

__Note:__
Work is offline, async, distributed and as time permits (because life happens too). We may meet (virtually or f2f) from time to time.


## Joining ⤵️

To be considered, members are required to contribute a project. It can be _anything_ helpful but substantial: infrastructure, tooling, documentation, or general help.
To apply, send an email to [dn@rng0.io](mailto:dn@rng0.io).
