# Rusty Ferris Club 🦀

A computer club for people who love Rust :crab:. We're also building stuff, and teaching each other stuff.

## Welcome to the Club! 👋

This is an old-school computer club brought to the 21st century. It's non-profit and open-source based, with the single goal of the _joy of learning and building in Rust_. 


By joining, you can expect the following:

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Having an available group of friends to meet and chat about topics in Rust.  
* 🏗️ Finding people for building _open source_ projects together and consult with, from idea to finish.  
* ❓ Getting a helping hand now and then from eachother maintaining your open source project.  
* 🧰 Enjoy building and using commonly built helpers, tools, and starters to get going with Rust quickly and effectively.  
* 👷‍♀️ Work is offline, async, distributed and as time permits (because life happens too). We may meet (virtually or f2f) from time to time.

To be considered, members are required to contribute a project. It can be _anything_ helpful but substantial: infrastructure, tooling, documentation, or general help.
