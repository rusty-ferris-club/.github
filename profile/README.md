# Rusty Ferris Club 🦀

A computer club for people who love Rust :crab:. We're also building stuff, and teaching each other stuff.

## Welcome to the Club! 👋

This is an old-school computer club brought to the 21st century. It's non-profit and open-source based, with the single goal of the _joy of learning and building in Rust_. 


By joining, you can expect the following:

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Having an available group of friends to meet and chat about topics in Rust.  
* 🏗️ Finding people for building _open source_ projects together and consult with, from idea to finish.  
* ❓ Getting a helping hand now and then from eachother maintaining your open source project.  
* 🧰 Enjoy building and using commonly built helpers, tools, and starters to get going with Rust quickly and effectively.  


## Joining ⤵️

To be considered, members are required to contribute a project. It can be _anything_ helpful but substantial: infrastructure, tooling, documentation, or general help.
To apply, send an email to [dn@rng0.io](mailto:dn@rng0.io).
